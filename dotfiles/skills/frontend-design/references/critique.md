# Critique

Adapted from Impeccable's `critique` and `audit` commands
([pbakaus/impeccable](https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable/tree/b7a89176e4e87422b40f98adabceb051dbb5448b/skill/reference),
Apache-2.0). The cognitive-load checklist, heuristics, severity scale, and personas are copied
verbatim; the per-heuristic scoring tables are condensed to one shared scale, and steps that need
Impeccable's CLI (detector, snapshot storage, live overlay) are removed.

## How to run a critique

Critique the rendered experience, not the source alone. Walk the primary task in a real browser at
desktop and narrow widths, with mouse and keyboard, using realistic data (see SKILL.md, step 4).

1. **Design review.** Judge hierarchy, information architecture, discoverability, composition,
   typography, color, states, copy, and edge cases as a design director would. Ask whether the
   composition and language are grounded in this product or could ship unchanged on an unrelated
   one.
2. **Cognitive load.** Run the checklist below; report any decision point with more than four
   visible options.
3. **Heuristics.** Score Nielsen's ten heuristics 0–4. Mark a heuristic `n/a` when the surface
   genuinely has no use for it (a static article has little need for accelerators) rather than
   forcing a number.
4. **Personas.** Walk the primary task as the two or three most relevant personas and record
   specific red flags.
5. **Technical checks.** Check the surface against
   [web-interface-guidelines.md](web-interface-guidelines.md) and the audit dimensions at the end of
   this file. Verify each finding in the browser before reporting it; drop false positives.

For a quick critique, follow the steps using the checklists and the report format. Read the
detailed heuristic and persona sections only when a score or a red flag is unclear. Use the full
treatment when the user asks for a review or audit.

When subagents are available and the surface matters, an independent reviewer that receives the
running URL and the brief (not your conclusions) gives a less anchored read. Do not delegate when a
quick self-review suffices.

## Report

Lead with what blocks the user. Keep P3s few: a long tail of minor issues buries the ones that
matter.

```markdown
## Critique: <surface>, <date>

Evidence: <viewports, input methods, states exercised, screenshots saved to …; what was not tested>

**Verdict:** <one or two sentences: does it do its job, and is it specific to this product?>

**Heuristics:** <total>/<max> (<band>) · **Cognitive load:** <failed items>/8

### What's working
- <2–3 strengths worth keeping>

### Priority issues
- **[P0|P1] <issue>.** <where> — <impact on the user> — <fix>

### Persona red flags
- **<persona>:** <specific red flag>

### Minor observations
- <P2/P3, briefly>
```

Fix P0 and P1 issues before asking the user for feedback; report what you fixed and what remains.

## Reference material

### Cognitive Load Assessment

Cognitive load is the total mental effort required to use an interface. Overloaded users make mistakes, get frustrated, and leave. This reference helps identify and fix cognitive overload.

---

#### Three Types of Cognitive Load

##### Intrinsic Load: The Task Itself
Complexity inherent to what the user is trying to do. You can't eliminate this, but you can structure it.

**Manage it by**:
- Breaking complex tasks into discrete steps
- Providing scaffolding (templates, defaults, examples)
- Progressive disclosure: show what's needed now, hide the rest
- Grouping related decisions together

##### Extraneous Load: Bad Design
Mental effort caused by poor design choices. **Eliminate this ruthlessly.** It's pure waste.

**Common sources**:
- Confusing navigation that requires mental mapping
- Unclear labels that force users to guess meaning
- Visual clutter competing for attention
- Inconsistent patterns that prevent learning
- Unnecessary steps between user intent and result

##### Germane Load: Learning Effort
Mental effort spent building understanding. This is *good* cognitive load; it leads to mastery.

**Support it by**:
- Progressive disclosure that reveals complexity gradually
- Consistent patterns that reward learning
- Feedback that confirms correct understanding
- Onboarding that teaches through action, not walls of text

---

#### Cognitive Load Checklist

Evaluate the interface against these 8 items:

- [ ] **Single focus**: Can the user complete their primary task without distraction from competing elements?
- [ ] **Chunking**: Is information presented in digestible groups (≤4 items per group)?
- [ ] **Grouping**: Are related items visually grouped together (proximity, borders, shared background)?
- [ ] **Visual hierarchy**: Is it immediately clear what's most important on the screen?
- [ ] **One thing at a time**: Can the user focus on a single decision before moving to the next?
- [ ] **Minimal choices**: Are decisions simplified (≤4 visible options at any decision point)?
- [ ] **Working memory**: Does the user need to remember information from a previous screen to act on the current one?
- [ ] **Progressive disclosure**: Is complexity revealed only when the user needs it?

**Scoring**: Count the failed items. 0–1 failures = low cognitive load (good). 2–3 = moderate (address soon). 4+ = high cognitive load (critical fix needed).

---

#### The Working Memory Rule

**Humans can hold ≤4 items in working memory at once** (Miller's Law revised by Cowan, 2001).

At any decision point, count the number of distinct options, actions, or pieces of information a user must simultaneously consider:
- **≤4 items**: Within working memory limits, manageable
- **5–7 items**: Pushing the boundary; consider grouping or progressive disclosure
- **8+ items**: Overloaded; users will skip, misclick, or abandon

**Practical applications**:
- Action buttons: 1 primary, 1–2 secondary, group the rest in a menu
- Navigation menus: ≤5 top-level items (group the rest under clear categories)
- Long-form articles: one reading path; gather related links into a single block at the end instead of scattering them mid-flow
- Documentation sidebars: ≤4 sibling choices visible per level before grouping kicks in
- Portfolio and gallery indexes: one decision per screen (which piece to open), not filter, sort, and tag controls all at once

---

#### Common Cognitive Load Violations

##### 1. The Wall of Options
**Problem**: Presenting 10+ choices at once with no hierarchy.
**Fix**: Group into categories, highlight recommended, use progressive disclosure.

##### 2. The Memory Bridge
**Problem**: User must remember info from step 1 to complete step 3.
**Fix**: Keep relevant context visible, or repeat it where it's needed.

##### 3. The Hidden Navigation
**Problem**: User must build a mental map of where things are.
**Fix**: Always show current location (breadcrumbs, active states, progress indicators).

##### 4. The Jargon Barrier
**Problem**: Technical or domain language forces translation effort.
**Fix**: Use plain language. If domain terms are unavoidable, define them inline.

##### 5. The Visual Noise Floor
**Problem**: Every element has the same visual weight; nothing stands out.
**Fix**: Establish clear hierarchy: one primary element, 2–3 secondary, everything else muted.

##### 6. The Inconsistent Pattern
**Problem**: Similar actions work differently in different places.
**Fix**: Standardize interaction patterns. Same type of action = same type of UI.

##### 7. The Multi-Task Demand
**Problem**: Interface requires processing multiple simultaneous inputs (reading + deciding + navigating).
**Fix**: Sequence the steps. Let the user do one thing at a time.

##### 8. The Context Switch
**Problem**: User must jump between screens/tabs/modals to gather info for a single decision.
**Fix**: Co-locate the information needed for each decision. Reduce back-and-forth.

### Heuristics scoring guide

Score each of Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics 0–4. Be honest: a 4 means genuinely excellent, not
"good enough."

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Absent or actively harmful; users are trapped, guessing, or blocked |
| 1 | Major gaps; the heuristic is honored only occasionally |
| 2 | Partial; main flows covered, significant gaps remain |
| 3 | Good; minor gaps, nothing confusing |
| 4 | Excellent; consistently honored throughout |

#### 1. Visibility of System Status

Keep users informed about what's happening through timely, appropriate feedback.

**Check for**:
- Loading indicators during async operations
- Confirmation of user actions (save, submit, delete)
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Current location in navigation (breadcrumbs, active states)
- Form validation feedback (inline, not just on submit)

#### 2. Match Between System and Real World

Speak the user's language. Follow real-world conventions. Information appears in natural, logical order.

**Check for**:
- Familiar terminology (no unexplained jargon)
- Logical information order matching user expectations
- Recognizable icons and metaphors
- Domain-appropriate language for the target audience
- Natural reading flow (left-to-right, top-to-bottom priority)

#### 3. User Control and Freedom

Users need a clear "emergency exit" from unwanted states without extended dialogue.

**Check for**:
- Undo/redo functionality
- Cancel buttons on forms and modals
- Clear navigation back to safety (home, previous)
- Easy way to clear filters, search, selections
- Escape from long or multi-step processes

#### 4. Consistency and Standards

Users shouldn't wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing.

**Check for**:
- Consistent terminology throughout the interface
- Same actions produce same results everywhere
- Platform conventions followed (standard UI patterns)
- Visual consistency (colors, typography, spacing, components)
- Consistent interaction patterns (same gesture = same behavior)

#### 5. Error Prevention

Better than good error messages is a design that prevents problems in the first place.

**Check for**:
- Confirmation before destructive actions (delete, overwrite)
- Constraints preventing invalid input (date pickers, dropdowns)
- Smart defaults that reduce errors
- Clear labels that prevent misunderstanding
- Autosave and draft recovery

#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

Minimize memory load. Make objects, actions, and options visible or easily retrievable.

**Check for**:
- Visible options (not buried in hidden menus)
- Contextual help when needed (tooltips, inline hints)
- Recent items and history
- Autocomplete and suggestions
- Labels on icons (not icon-only navigation)

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Accelerators, invisible to novices, speed up expert interaction.

**Check for**:
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- Customizable interface elements
- Recent items and favorites
- Bulk/batch actions
- Power user features that don't complicate the basics

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Interfaces should not contain irrelevant or rarely needed information. Every element should serve a purpose.

**Check for**:
- Only necessary information visible at each step
- Clear visual hierarchy directing attention
- Purposeful use of color and emphasis
- No decorative clutter competing for attention
- Focused, uncluttered layouts

#### 9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error messages should use plain language, precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

**Check for**:
- Plain language error messages (no error codes for users)
- Specific problem identification ("Email is missing @" not "Invalid input")
- Actionable recovery suggestions
- Errors displayed near the source of the problem
- Non-blocking error handling (don't wipe the form)

#### 10. Help and Documentation

Even if the system is usable without docs, help should be easy to find, task-focused, and concise.

**Check for**:
- Searchable help or documentation
- Contextual help (tooltips, inline hints, guided tours)
- Task-focused organization (not feature-organized)
- Concise, scannable content
- Easy access without leaving current context

### Score Summary

**Total possible**: 40 points (10 heuristics × 4 max)

| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 36–40 | Excellent | Minor polish only; ship it |
| 28–35 | Good | Address weak areas, solid foundation |
| 20–27 | Acceptable | Significant improvements needed before users are happy |
| 12–19 | Poor | Major UX overhaul required; core experience broken |
| 0–11 | Critical | Redesign needed; unusable in current state |

When heuristics were scored `n/a`, the maximum is lower than 40; read the band off the percentage instead of the raw number (90%+ Excellent, 70%+ Good, 50%+ Acceptable, 30%+ Poor, below that Critical). 24/32 is 75%, so Good.

---

### Issue Severity (P0–P3)

Tag each individual issue found during scoring with a priority level:

| Priority | Name | Description | Action |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | Blocking | Prevents task completion entirely | Fix immediately; this is a showstopper |
| **P1** | Major | Causes significant difficulty or confusion | Fix before release |
| **P2** | Minor | Annoyance, but workaround exists | Fix in next pass |
| **P3** | Polish | Nice-to-fix, no real user impact | Fix if time permits |

**Tip**: If you're unsure between two levels, ask: "Would a user contact support about this?" If yes, it's at least P1.

---

### Persona-Based Design Testing

Test the interface through the eyes of 5 distinct user archetypes. Each persona exposes different failure modes that a single "design director" perspective would miss.

**How to use**: Select 2–3 personas most relevant to the interface being critiqued. Walk through the primary user action as each persona. Report specific red flags, not generic concerns.

---

#### 1. Impatient Power User: "Alex"


**Profile**: Expert with similar products. Expects efficiency, hates hand-holding. Will find shortcuts or leave.

**Behaviors**:
- Skips all onboarding and instructions
- Looks for keyboard shortcuts immediately
- Tries to bulk-select, batch-edit, and automate
- Gets frustrated by required steps that feel unnecessary
- Abandons if anything feels slow or patronizing

**Test Questions**:
- Can Alex complete the core task in under 60 seconds?
- Are there keyboard shortcuts for common actions?
- Can onboarding be skipped entirely?
- Do modals have keyboard dismiss (Esc)?
- Is there a "power user" path (shortcuts, bulk actions)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Forced tutorials or unskippable onboarding
- No keyboard navigation for primary actions
- Slow animations that can't be skipped
- One-item-at-a-time workflows where batch would be natural
- Redundant confirmation steps for low-risk actions

---

#### 2. Confused First-Timer: "Jordan"

**Profile**: Never used this type of product. Needs guidance at every step. Will abandon rather than figure it out.

**Behaviors**:
- Reads all instructions carefully
- Hesitates before clicking anything unfamiliar
- Looks for help or support constantly
- Misunderstands jargon and abbreviations
- Takes the most literal interpretation of any label

**Test Questions**:
- Is the first action obviously clear within 5 seconds?
- Are all icons labeled with text?
- Is there contextual help at decision points?
- Does terminology assume prior knowledge?
- Is there a clear "back" or "undo" at every step?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Icon-only navigation with no labels
- Technical jargon without explanation
- No visible help option or guidance
- Ambiguous next steps after completing an action
- No confirmation that an action succeeded

---

#### 3. Accessibility-Dependent User: "Sam"

**Profile**: Uses screen reader (VoiceOver/NVDA), keyboard-only navigation. May have low vision, motor impairment, or cognitive differences.

**Behaviors**:
- Tabs through the interface linearly
- Relies on ARIA labels and heading structure
- Cannot see hover states or visual-only indicators
- Needs adequate color contrast (4.5:1 minimum)
- May use browser zoom up to 200%

**Test Questions**:
- Can the entire primary flow be completed keyboard-only?
- Are all interactive elements focusable with visible focus indicators?
- Do images have meaningful alt text?
- Is color contrast WCAG AA compliant (4.5:1 for text)?
- Does the screen reader announce state changes (loading, success, errors)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Click-only interactions with no keyboard alternative
- Missing or invisible focus indicators
- Meaning conveyed by color alone (red = error, green = success)
- Unlabeled form fields or buttons
- Time-limited actions without extension option
- Custom components that break screen reader flow

---

#### 4. Deliberate Stress Tester: "Riley"

**Profile**: Methodical user who pushes interfaces beyond the happy path. Tests edge cases, tries unexpected inputs, and probes for gaps in the experience.

**Behaviors**:
- Tests edge cases intentionally (empty states, long strings, special characters)
- Submits forms with unexpected data (emoji, RTL text, very long values)
- Tries to break workflows by navigating backwards, refreshing mid-flow, or opening in multiple tabs
- Looks for inconsistencies between what the UI promises and what actually happens
- Documents problems methodically

**Test Questions**:
- What happens at the edges (0 items, 1000 items, very long text)?
- Do error states recover gracefully or leave the UI in a broken state?
- What happens on refresh mid-workflow? Is state preserved?
- Are there features that appear to work but produce broken results?
- How does the UI handle unexpected input (emoji, special chars, paste from Excel)?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Features that appear to work but silently fail or produce wrong results
- Error handling that exposes technical details or leaves UI in a broken state
- Empty states that show nothing useful ("No results" with no guidance)
- Workflows that lose user data on refresh or navigation
- Inconsistent behavior between similar interactions in different parts of the UI

---

#### 5. Distracted Mobile User: "Casey"

**Profile**: Using phone one-handed on the go. Frequently interrupted. Possibly on a slow connection.

**Behaviors**:
- Uses thumb only; prefers bottom-of-screen actions
- Gets interrupted mid-flow and returns later
- Switches between apps frequently
- Has limited attention span and low patience
- Types as little as possible, prefers taps and selections

**Test Questions**:
- Are primary actions in the thumb zone (bottom half of screen)?
- Is state preserved if the user leaves and returns?
- Does it work on slow connections (3G)?
- Can forms use autocomplete and smart defaults?
- Are touch targets at least 44×44pt?

**Red Flags** (report these specifically):
- Important actions positioned at the top of the screen (unreachable by thumb)
- No state persistence; progress lost on tab switch or interruption
- Large text inputs required where selection would work
- Heavy assets loading on every page (no lazy loading)
- Tiny tap targets or targets too close together

---

#### Selecting Personas

Choose personas based on the interface type:

| Interface Type | Primary Personas | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| Landing page / marketing | Jordan, Riley, Casey | First impressions, trust, mobile |
| Dashboard / admin | Alex, Sam | Power users, accessibility |
| E-commerce / checkout | Casey, Riley, Jordan | Mobile, edge cases, clarity |
| Onboarding flow | Jordan, Casey | Confusion, interruption |
| Data-heavy / analytics | Alex, Sam | Efficiency, keyboard nav |
| Form-heavy / wizard | Jordan, Sam, Casey | Clarity, accessibility, mobile |

---

#### Project-specific personas

When DESIGN.md records real users, derive one or two more personas from them using the same
profile, behaviors, and red-flags shape. Never invent audience details; use the five personas
above when no user context exists.

### Audit dimensions

Score each 0–4 when a technical audit is requested; otherwise use them as a checklist.

- **Accessibility:** contrast below 4.5:1 (3:1 for large text); `prefers-reduced-motion` handled
  with an intentional alternative that preserves state changes, not a global kill that destroys
  useful feedback; missing roles, labels, or states; keyboard traps, illogical tab order, missing
  focus indicators; heading hierarchy and landmarks; alt text; unlabeled inputs and unclear errors.
- **Performance:** layout reads and writes in loops; casual layout-property animation or unbounded
  blur/filter/shadow effects; images not lazy-loaded or sized; `will-change` left on at rest;
  unnecessary re-renders and unused dependencies.
- **Theming:** colors not using tokens; broken or low-contrast dark mode; values that do not update
  on theme change.
- **Responsive:** fixed widths that break on mobile; touch targets under 44×44px (WCAG 2.5.8
  requires at least 24×24 CSS px unless spacing or another exception applies); horizontal scroll at
  narrow widths; layouts that break at 200% text size; custom drag or slider controls that fail
  under touch or stay stuck after an interrupted gesture.
- **Implementation integrity:** repeated shortcuts, drift from the project's components and
  tokens, misleading or decorative content, and structure interchangeable with an unrelated
  product.
